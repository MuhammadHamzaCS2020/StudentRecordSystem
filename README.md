# StudentRecordSystem
This is a Student Record System for Any School

#Problem Statement

Write a program (in the language of your choice) to implement a directory of a set of student records by using open addressing. Your program should take its input from a text file “namal.txt”, which is stored in the same folder as that of your .java file. The format of a line in the input file is: LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME; 01234567; MR; YR; student@namal.edu.pk; 555-555-5555; 666-666-666

Where LAST_NAME is the last name, FIRST_NAME is the first name, 01234567 is 8-digit student ID, MR is the student major (e.g. EE, CS, SE), YR is the student year (1, 2, 3, 4), student@namal.edu.pk is the email address, 555-555-5555 is the student’s home phone number , and 666-666-6666 is the work phone number. Semicolon is the field separator. It is possible for a student to not have one or more fields. For example, a student may not have work phone number. Your program should implement the directory of the records in the file by using the following hash

function: H(key)=(sum(ASCII values of all characters in key)%B) Where KEY is the last name and B is the smallest prime number larger than the number of records in the file. After creating the hash table of the records in the file, the program displays a menu of commands that the user can enter to perform different functions on the directory. The menu should contain at least the following commands:

# Two Way Options 
You can use this by Consle and Buttons
    This is Consoe Districption
D KEY For deleting the record corresponding to KEY from the directory
E KEY For inserting/changing email address in the record for KEY
F For writing all student records in the original file, one record at a time, in sorted order.
H KEY For inserting/changing home phone number in the record for KEY
I Key For inserting/changing the record corresponding to KEY in the directory.
P Key For pulling the record corresponding to KEY from the directory and displaying it on the screen. Data Structures and Algorithms Malik Jahan Khan January 25, 2012
P For displaying all records one record per line, in sorted order.
W For inserting/changing work phone number in the record for KEY
Q To quit

# Using Buttons
Buttons Districption is Not metter because you can see those on GUI and easily you can use them.
